# Revised Agenda

Due to the issues with the Jupyter Notebooks, (and the lack of time), we'll focus more on the other parts of the workshop, that are not so heavily dependent on Jupyter.

## 16:00 -- 16:15

Discussion on the Forensic Exercise (Organization Exercise 01 [html](notebooks/02_organization_exercise_01.html))

## 16:15 -- 16:45

Project Organization

## 16:45 -- 17:15

Organization Exercise 02 [html](notebooks/03_organization_exercise_02.html)

## 17:15 -- 18:15

Publication & Sharing Exercise [html](notebooks/06_publication_and_sharing.html)

## S21 Introduction, 11:30 -- 12:30

This would be the introductory session for concept of Reproducible Research

- The slides of the introduction are available [here](./pdfs/S21_Introduction.pdf)
- To follow allong, during the Jupyter section, you need to 
  follow the instructions from here [Workshop Preperation](notebooks/00_preperation.html).
- [Introduction to Jupyter](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/introduction-RR-Jupyter/slides/Jupyter_Intro_Background.slides.html#/)
- [Working with Notebooks](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/introduction-RR-Jupyter/slides/Workshop%20slides%20-%20using%20the%20notebooks.slides.html#/)
- Now, for the remaining time open (from your Jupyter Browser), the notebook `01_navigation.ipynb` and read / evaluate all of it's cells
  
## S22 Organization & Data Exploration 14:00 -- 15:30
  
In this part we'll talk about how to better organize a project. Your first (practical) task is to follow the instructions from the Organization Exercise 01.

  
  - The slides would be later available [here]()

## S23 Automation, 16:00 -- 17:30

Here, we'll automate the analysis from the previous step by implementing functions

## S24 Publication & Sharing, 17:30 -- 18:30

Here we'll see how to export a notebook, share it, and publish our results.
